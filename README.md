As I was growing up and I had a passion in technology and I thought to myself that one day I desire to be a technology expert performing amazing things in my community, nationwide and worldwide. The inspiration to technology passion was because of my mother's mobile phone which I used to operate when I was young and that's how I progressed through to high school and did computer studies as one of my graded subjects and after that I got the sponsorship from ALX to study software engineering as I desired to be one before. Now because I love technology I always need get solutions to technology difficulties immediately when I need them, as I was doing my research I realized there was a lack of such sort services and this led me to develop this kind of portfolio project. This project also was to test my skills and understanding of what was learnt for 9 months.
Generally, it was to simplify or to make it easy for people to get solutions on the technology difficulties.
I first did the project proposal which gave a go ahead and overview of what it was to be done
